# Healthcare-Insurance-Fraudulance

Introduction

     Health care fraud is a pressing problem where some providers and doctors claim millions of dollars every day by submitting duplicate bills or by manipulating bills, which in turn impact common people with increase in the cost of medical insurance program. It is a type of white-collar crime because not all fraud is detected and where all suspicious claims turn out to be fraudulent. According to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid service, out of 1.1 trillion spent on health care coverage $95 billion is constituted as improper payment which is connected to fraud. Most common types of Medicare frauds:
1.	Double Billing:  
	        The providers charge twice for the same service or product.
2.	Phantom Billing:  
	        This is a common type of fraud where billing is provided for the test, procedure or other medical service which is not performed.

3.	Upcoding:  
	      In this type, the claim code is adjusted such a way that they can charge more than the service that was performed.

4.	Unbundling:  
       This involves taking a comprehensive service and separating it into several specific services to bill for each one independently. This leads to a higher reimbursement total.
